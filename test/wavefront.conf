##############################################################################
#
# The prefix should either be left undefined, or can be any  prefix you want
#    prepended to all data points coming from this agent (such as 'prod').
#
# Examples:
#
#    #prefix=
#    prefix=prod.nyc
#

#prefix=production

# The server should be either the primary Wavefront cloud server, or your custom VPC address.
#   This will be provided to you by Wavefront.
#
server=http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/

# The hostname will be used to identify the internal agent statistics around point rates, JVM info, etc.
#  We strongly recommend setting this to a name that is unique among your entire infrastructure,
#   possibly including the datacenter information, etc. This hostname does not need to correspond to
#   any actual hostname or DNS entry; it's merely a string that we pass with the internal stats.
#
#hostname=my.agent.host.com

# The Token is any valid API Token for your account, which can be generated from the gear icon
#   at the top right of the Wavefront site, under 'Settings'. Paste that hexadecimal token
#   after the '=' below, and the agent will automatically generate a machine-specific UUID and
#   self-register.
# If you don't set this token here, you can still register the agent through the normal web flow.
#
#token=XXX

#Comma separated list of ports to listen on for Wavefront formatted data
pushListenerPorts=2878
#Comma separated list of ports to listen on for OpenTSDB formatted data
opentsdbPorts=4242
#Comma separated list of ports to listen on for HTTP JSON formatted data
jsonListenerPorts=3878
#Comma separated list of ports to listen on for write_http collectd formatted
writeHttpListenerPorts=4878

# Max points per flush. Typically 40000.
pushFlushMaxPoints=40000

# Milliseconds between flushes to the Wavefront servers. Typically 1000.
pushFlushInterval=1000

# If there are blocked points, how many lines to print to the log every 10 flushes. Typically 5.
pushBlockedSamples=5

# The push log level determines how much information will be printed to the log.
#   Options: NONE, SUMMARY, DETAILED. Typically SUMMARY.
pushLogLevel=SUMMARY

# The validation level keeps certain data from being sent to Wavefront.
#   We strongly recommend keeping this at NUMERIC_ONLY
#   Options: NUMERIC_ONLY, NO_VALIDATION.
pushValidationLevel=NUMERIC_ONLY

# When using the Wavefront or TSDB data formats the Proxy will automatically look for a tag named
# source= or host= (preferring source=) and treat that as the source/host within Wavefront.
# customSourceTags is a comma separated, ordered list of additional tag keys to use if neither
# source= or host= is present
customSourceTags=fqdn, hostname

## Which ports should listen for collectd/graphite-formatted data?
## If you uncomment graphitePorts, make sure to uncomment and set 'graphiteFormat' and 'graphiteDelimiters' as well.
#graphitePorts=2003

## Which fields (1-based) should we extract and concatenate (with dots) as the hostname?
#graphiteFormat=2

## Which characters should be replaced by dots in the hostname, after extraction?
#graphiteDelimiters=_
#graphiteFieldsToRemove=1

# Which ports to listen for Graphite pickle formatted data (from carbon-relay)
# This is expecting streaming data formatted as:
# [Length of pickled data to follow in a 4 byte unsigned int][pickled data of the given length]...
picklePorts=5878

# Which ports to listen for collectd/write_http JSON formatted traffic on
writeHttpJsonListenerPorts=4878

## ID file for agent
idFile=./.wavefront_id

## Number of threads retrying failed transmissions. Defaults to the number of processors (min. 4)
## Buffer files are maxed out at 2G each so increasing the number of retry threads effectively governs
## the maximum amount of space the agent will use to buffer points locally
#retryThreads=4

## Regex pattern (java.util.regex) that input lines must match to be accepted.
## Input lines are checked against the pattern before the prefix is prepended.
#allow=^(production|stage).*

## Regex pattern (java.util.regex) that input lines must NOT match to be accepted.
## Input lines are checked against the pattern before the prefix is prepended.
#block=^(qa|development|test).*

## Whether to split the push batch size when the push is rejected by Wavefront due to rate limit.  Default false.
#splitPushWhenRateLimited=false

## For exponential backoff when retry threads are throttled, the base (a in a^b) in seconds.  Default 2.0
#retryBackoffBaseSeconds=2.0
